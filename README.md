Project Overview
The Advanced House Price Prediction Model aims to assist real estate agents, buyers, and sellers by providing accurate house price estimates. The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing
Feature engineering
Model training using various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost
Model evaluation and tuning
Deployment using Flask for real-time predictions
Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Ames Housing Dataset from Kaggle, which contains detailed information on individual properties in Ames, Iowa.

Source: Ames Housing Dataset
Features: 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
Target: Sale price of the houses.
Features
Some key features in the dataset include:

Lot Area: Lot size in square feet.
OverallQual: Overall material and finish quality.
YearBuilt: Year the house was built.
TotalBsmtSF: Total square footage of the basement.
GrLivArea: Above grade (ground) living area square footage.
GarageCars: Size of garage in car capacity.
Neighborhood: Physical location within Ames city limits.
